<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	Hi there! I am Tomy Jaya. I dream of building a successful value-creating tech startup with a focus on the sharing economy (marketplace), especially for the emerging markets. You know, sites like Airbnb and Uber. But to earn a living, and somehow keep me grounded, I currently work as a software engineer in a payment tech startup in Singapore. :)
</p>

<h3>My Personality</h3>
<p>
	I am on the pragmatic, rather than the idealist side of the technology world.
</p>
<p>
	Though very opinionated, I am not afraid to admit and apologize when I am wrong.
</p>

<h3>My Passion</h3>
<p>
	 I’m comfortable roaming back and forth the full stack. Nevertheless, my programming language of choice is Java. Lately, I’ve also started picking up JavaScript and its popular frameworks as both as a hobby and for work.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from hands-on coding and providing solutions, my passion lies on software engineering, continuous improvements, applying best practices to software development.
<p>
<p> Technologies I'm trying to master: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Spring (it just rocks!)</li>
	<li>ReactJS</li>
	<li>Bootstrap (made non-designers like me look like a pro!)</li>
	<li>React Native (well, mobile is now and the future.)</li>
	<li>MongoDB (or other noSQL DB family, not a mongo fanatic yet..)</li>
</ol>

<h3>My Other Interests</h3>
<p> 
	My other non-software related interests include Music (Vocal and Instrumental), Education, Movies and TV Series, Soccer, Psychology, Statistics, and last but not least Personal Development.  (Seems like an endless list, huh?) 
<p>

<h3>My Idols</h3>
<p>People whom I admire and wish to become: </p>
