<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Hi There! My name is Tomy Jaya. If you are curious to know more about me, you can read more about me <a href="/about">here</a>. </p>


<h1>How This Blog Was born?</h1>

<ul>
    <li>As I embark on my journey to pursue my dream to build a startup part-time, I hope this blog can be the by-product of the process which people might benefit. <strong>See:</strong> <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products">"Sell Your By-Product" from the awesome book <a href="http://amzn.to/2rfISJu">Rework</a></li>
    <li>Also, my colleague who goes by the honoured title of “Sir Mohan” had <em>repeatedly</em> encouraged me to start writing. It has got to a point that it will be kind of rude of me to ignore his advice. :)</li>
    <li>Lastly, I was inspired by <a href="https://www.quora.com/I-feel-like-Im-wasting-my-time-when-Im-reading-Is-that-wrong/answer/Gary-Wu-8">this answer on Quora</a>. I couldn’t agree more with his answer; I’ve got to shift my C:P ratio to the production side!</li>
