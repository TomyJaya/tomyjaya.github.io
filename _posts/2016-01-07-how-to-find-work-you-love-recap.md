# The Summary

I recently watched a quite long [TED Talk by Scott Dinsmore entitled 'How to find work you love'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR6P5Qdvlnk).

As it's quite long, below are the gists of the talk. 

To help you find the work you love, you should: 

1. Master knowing about yourself (find what you want)
2. Push your limit
3. Surround yourself with passionate people

All the best in finding the work you love!
