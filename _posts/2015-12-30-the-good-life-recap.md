# The Summary

I recently watched a [TED Talk by Robert Waldinger entitled The Good Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-7zAkwAOYg).

Here is the key point: 

* The key to a good life is good relationships. (not wealth, nor fame) 

Here are the important lessons: 

1. When you retire happier, you'll have less memory problems. 
2. To be happy, find a spouse which you can count on. 

The conclusion of this talk is no mere theory, it's backed by 75 years worth of research. 
So, it's definitely something worth reflecting about..
