# The Angular 2 Dilemma

When I decided to pick up Angular 2, I was faced with a dilemma of whether I should use TypeScript or JavaScript (note: Angular 2 supports 3 languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, and Google's Dart). 

TypeScript is a new language for me and having spent quite some with other JavaScript frameworks, I thought JavaScript will be a straightforward choice. 

Nevertheless, you'd be surprised to know that after much deliberation, I chose **TypeScript** over JavaScript.   

# Why TypeScript?

Well, here are the reasons (in increasing significance): 

1. The framework itself "encourages" you to use TypeScript
2. Both Google and Microsoft - 2 software Giants - are collaborating to develop this language
3. TypeScript is a **strict superset** of JavaScript. This is the most important point. This means, in the event that the community favors Angular 2 with JavaScript and when in StackOverflow you see a proliferation of JavaScript answers to Angular 2 problems, you will fret not. You can easily copy paste the solutions verbatim and they will work *seamlessly*. And I'm afraid you can't say otherwise. 

Let me know of your thoughts below. In the meantime, while learning TypeScript, I should probably spawn a new Gist for my TypeScript notes (aka cheatsheet). That's coming up! :)
