# [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](http://amzn.to/2qFr2T1) Book Recap


A few gems I managed to extract from this [book](http://amzn.to/2qFr2T1) includes:

* Aim for vertical progress (i.e. 0 to 1). Therefore, be bold and take risks! 
* Start Small (dominate niche), scale up, and then build monopoly (long term vision). 
* Monopoly is not necessarily evil. 
    * Competitive markets destroy profits
    * Even companies like Google downplay their monopoly by diluting their search engine market share with their brand as multi-faceted Tech company. 
    * To Build monopoly, create: Proprietary Technology, Network Effects, Economies of scale, Branding
    * Be 10x better and escape competition
* Last Mover Advantage: 

> "it's much better to be the last mover - that is to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits. 

* Again, start small: 

> "Paradoxically, network effects businesses must start with especially small markets" 

E.g. Facebook starting exclusively as harvard.edu

* Due to power law, you can't blindly diversify. In startups, this means:

> you should not necessarily start your own company. Even if you are extraordinarily talented. 
> If anything, too many people are starting their own companies today.
> People who understand the power law will hesitate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture:
> they know how tremendously successful they can become by joining the very best company while it's growing fast.

E.g. 100% of equity of your failed startup is nothing compared to 0.001% of Google. Hence, be wise and follow the money. 

* Beginning & Founders chemistry are key. Without these solid foundations, your company is doomed. 
* Computer & Humans hand in hand will be the future. E.g. CIA spies (human) + NSA wiretaps(data) = Palantir
* 7 questions on startup:
    * Engineering:  a breakthrough?
    * Timing: the right time?
    * Monopoly: a big share of a small market?
    * People: the right team?
    * Distribution: delivery feasible?
    * Durability: defensible market share for 10 to 20 years?
    * Secret: unique opportunity others don't see?
* Best founders bring out the best work from everybody in their company.
