# The Summary

In an effort to check off one of my New Year's resolutions (i.e. to watch 12 TED Talks this year), I recently watched a [TED Talk by Bel Pesce entitled '5 ways to kill a dream'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR6P5Qdvlnk).

Here is the 5 ways to kill a dream: 

1. Blame as someone else's fault
2. Believe in overnight success
3. Don't value the journey
4. Settle down when there's guaranteed growth
5. Believe someone else has the answers

Will make sure to stay away from 'em..
