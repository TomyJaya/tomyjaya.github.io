<p>I have to say that setting up your own blog on Github Pages is really fun! </p>

* First, hosting is free!
* Second, you got to learn jekyll which is pretty awesome. 
* Third, you finally have a place to practice your markdown syntax and git commands. Keep learning yo!

<h2 class="section-heading">How I Set it up</h2>

<p>In case you want to set up your own, for your reference, I followed the below tutorials/ resources to set up my pages: </p>
1. [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) - Read about it and spend 5 minutes launching your first hello World! 
2. [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)  -  Follow this to set up a barebone jekyll-powered github pages blog.
3. [https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) - I applied this clean Bootstrap template to make the pages look more professional.
