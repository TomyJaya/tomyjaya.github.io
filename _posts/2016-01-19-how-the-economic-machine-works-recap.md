# The Summary

I recently watched [Ray Dalio's video entitled How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0).

Here is the key point: 

* Credit causes short-term and long term debt cycle

Here are the 3 important lessons: 

1. Don't borrow more than your income
2. Don't earn more than your productivity; otherwise, you might become uncompetitive
3. Focus on being more productive as it is what matters in the long run

I highly recommend the above video not only to people working in the finance industry, but also to everyone. I really mean, everyone..

For those who don't know [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio), he is the legendary fund manager and founder of Bridgewater Associates.
