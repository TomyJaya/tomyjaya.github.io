# GTD

GTD or Getting Things Done is a time management method created by David Allen. You can view the TED talk below for the key ideas of GTD: 

[The Art of Stress-Free Productivity: David Allen at TEDxClaremontColleges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHxhjDPKfbY)

Personally, if you are short of time, I wouldn't recommend reading the [book](http://amzn.to/2qftzCC) as it's just basically a rehash of the same principles.

Some important key points from the book: 

* The GTD Flowchart: 

![The GTD Flowchart](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/99/b2/f5/99b2f5153317838b1a2d7478df569ef1.jpg "The GTD Flowchart")

* Have a **system** (physical or virtual) which maps with the items in the flow chart. Mine is using OneNote + Outlook for my office work and Evernote + Gmail/ Google Calendar for my personal work. 
* **Bootstrap** your system by initially *capturing* everything into your in-trays and process them accordingly. [^1] Once done, you should have a list of *Next Actions* you can work on and hopefully a clear *"mind like water"* to jumpstart your productive day. 
* Have **Weekly Review**s and don't forget to review your **Someday/ Maybe List** as well. 
* GTD is in line with research findings in cognitive science. Three of which I find the most relevant are: 
  * The Value of External Mind (utiling external system to manage ideas so that our brain can think better)
  * Relieving the cognitive load of Incompletions
  * Flow Theory
* If GTD can be implemented organizational-wide, the benefit will be immense. Everyone has a trusted functioning system, thereby leaving no room for any communication gap. 

Some quotes I like from the book: 

* About compartmentalizing "open loop" to regain your attention: "You must use your mind to get things off your mind"
* "It is better to be wrong than to be vague." -  Freeman Dyson
* "Someday/ Maybes are not throwaway items. They may be some of the most interesting and creative things you'll ever get involved with. "
* "Checklist can be highly useful to let you know what you *don't* need to be concerned about"
* "The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one. " - Mark Twain
* "Start by doing what's necessary, then what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible. " - Saint Francis of Assisi
* "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. "

# Inbox Zero
The Inbox Zero methodology complements GTD really well. Watch the below 1-hour Google Talk to learn about Inbox Zero:

# Key Idea

Both GTD and Inbox Zero share one seemingly simple fundamental key idea which is *introducing a system to reduce clutter*. I have implemented both of them in my professional and personal life; as such, I can attest to their efficacy. In short, they really work. 


Now that you know these hidden gems, you're all set to boost your productivity. Good luck!
